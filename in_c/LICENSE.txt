This is derivative work of Neil Conway's dataflow_bench,
which is NOT published under any particular license,
and also uses D.R.Hanson's libcii, which is MIT licensed.

I would not recommend using this code for any purpose whatsoever;
it was probably not legal for me to have written it,
and I'm not giving any kind of permission either.
